// The gpui surface this library touches, as declarations, for generation only.
//
// gpui-shell writes a complete `gpui.d.ts` into every directory that imports a
// built-in module, from the runtime that is about to run — which is why that
// file is never committed anywhere, including here. A library cannot depend on
// it: `bun run types` has to emit the same declarations on a machine with no
// gpui-shell installed, and emit them the same way twice.
//
// So this file names the handful of gpui and gpui-base entries `src/` actually
// imports, and nothing else. It is not shipped: the declarations in `types/`
// only ever *refer* to `import("gpui").Color` and friends, and those names
// resolve, in an application, against the real generated `gpui.d.ts` sitting
// beside the application's own sources. Two `declare module "gpui"` blocks in
// one program would collide, which is the other reason this one stays home.
//
// Elements are deliberately loose. Reproducing GPUI's style surface here would
// be reproducing twenty thousand lines that the runtime already generates, and
// the only thing declaration emit needs from an element is that a chain of
// style calls is still an element — so `build()` says `Element` rather than
// `any` in the file an application reads.
